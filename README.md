## iLife
The project tries to bring all service activities into one place. Do you need a pedicure, dentist appointment, or reservation in the restaurant iLife has you covered. This project is a prototype and WILL NOT BE IN USE. The plan is to rebuild it from scratch using better and maybe safer technologies. It was used for a final work in high school and a plan is to make it perfect. We hope we will make it throughout 1 - 2 years.

Technologies used:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- NextAuth
- TailWindCSS
- MongoDB
